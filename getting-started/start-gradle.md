# Start Gradle

## Chose a build system
LITIENGNINE supports Gradle and Maven. You can just download the .jar file and import it to use the library, but it is not recommended. Thus, here we will discuss how to install and start Gradle in Windows.  

## Download Gradle
You can download Gradle [Here](https://gradle.org/install/).

In the first step for **Installing manually**, click the **Download** and find latest version. If you need docs and sources, choose **complete** or binary-only.  
Then create a new directory `C:\Gradle` and unzip the downloaded file in this folder.  
Search the `Advanced system setting` on windows search and click click `Environment Variables`. Under `Systemp Variables` selet `Path`, then double click it. Add `C:\Gradle\[your-gradle-version]\bin` and click OK to save.
