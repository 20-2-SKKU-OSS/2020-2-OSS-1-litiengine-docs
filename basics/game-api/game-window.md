# Game Window

### Resolution Scaling

If resolution scaling is enabled \(gfx\_enableResolutionScale=true in the Game configuration\), everyone will see the same portion of the environment regardless of their resolution. If not, everyone will have pixels that are the same size but the viewport differs depending on the window resolution.
