# Map Creation and Management

Once you have gained a basic understanding of LITIengine's general game infrastructure, it is time to actually create a world for your game to take place in. LITIengine uses [.tmx tile maps](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/), a universally acclaimed standard format for 2D level building.
