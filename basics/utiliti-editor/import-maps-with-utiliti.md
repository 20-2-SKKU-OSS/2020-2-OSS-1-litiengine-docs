# Import maps

Hit “**Map -&gt; Import...**”  
In the file browser that pops up, navigate to your map file and hit “**Open**“.  
If the import was successful, your map will be rendered in the large map panel, and a new entry to your project's map list will be made.  
Of course, you can select multiple maps to be imported at once.
