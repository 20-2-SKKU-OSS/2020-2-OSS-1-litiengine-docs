# Create Projects

Start the utiLITI editor. Hit “**File -&gt; Create project**” \(Shortcut: **CTRL+N**\).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/1-createproject.png)

In the file browser that pops up, navigate to your project directory and hit “**open**“.  
Even if you still have done nothing, hit **save** to create a _game resource file_.  
You can name your _game resource file_ whatever you want, we might refer to it as “game.litidata” later on.
